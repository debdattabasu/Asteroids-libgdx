SIMPLE ASTEROIDS GAME FOR LIBGDX
This is a simple Asteroids game I made for an interview at Electronic Arts Hyderabad. 

IMPORTANT
This project is for desktop only, and the Android project will not work. This is because the game uses Keyboard Input, 
which is unavailable for Android. The project is a DUMMY, and exists only because LibGdx requires an Android Project for the
Asset Paths.

REQUIREMENTS
	1. Windows Desktop
	2. Java Runtime
	3. Eclipse for compilation
